# Fullscreen Fix Verification

## Issue
The app was limited to a maximum window size of 1000x800 pixels on Windows, preventing proper fullscreen mode.

## Root Cause
In `main.go`, the Wails application configuration had:
```go
MaxWidth:  1000,
MaxHeight: 800,
```

These constraints prevented the window from expanding beyond 1000x800 pixels, making fullscreen mode only expand to half the screen on modern displays.

## Fix Applied
Removed the `MaxWidth` and `MaxHeight` constraints from the window configuration in `main.go`.

## Before Fix:
- Window was constrained to maximum 1000x800 pixels
- Fullscreen mode would only expand to these dimensions

## After Fix:
- Window can expand to any size supported by the display
- Fullscreen mode works properly on all screen resolutions
- Window can be resized to 1920x1080, 2560x1440, or any other resolution

## Test Results
✅ Application builds successfully
✅ Window can be resized to 1920x1080 (Full HD)
✅ Window can be resized to 1600x1000 (larger than previous limit)
✅ No regression in minimum window size constraints (520x500 still enforced)

## Screenshots
- `app_normal.png`: Application in normal windowed mode
- `app_maximized.png`: Application maximized to 1920x1080
- `app_1600x1000.png`: Application resized to 1600x1000 (above previous limit)
